# Semantic HIGH Verification Report

Status: **IN PROGRESS**
Date: 2026-10-05
Branch: `audit-v5`

## Queue normalization

- Calibrated HIGH issuers: 836
- Raw HIGH signals: 1,410
- Unique HIGH claims after stable claim-level deduplication: 1,399
- Duplicate signal instances removed from semantic workload: 11

Signal mix (unique claims): objective ranking/market share 941; material named relationship 317; profitability 67; identity-changing event 42; export concentration 27; control acquisition 5.

## Author review progress

Batch `author-001`: 8 unique HIGH claims reviewed against inspected sources.

- ACCEPTED by author: 5
- PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED: 2
- UNSUPPORTED: 1
- Remaining author queue: 1,391

Notable correction: the report claim that Green Jade is Asia's largest is contradicted by current official CDWE material, which describes it as the largest Taiwan-flagged vessel and Asia's second-largest wind-power engineering vessel. Proposed repair is recorded in `semantic/author-001.json`.

Other partial findings: AIDC evidence supports 燁鋒 as an aerospace raw-material/aluminum supplier but not the exact 'Asia's only' ranking; inspected evidence supports China Steel as a plate supplier to Jong Shyn but not yet the qualifier 'major'.

## Independent review

Final HIGH acceptance remains pending independent reviewer separation. An attempted GitHub Models reviewer was not used because GitHub Models inference was retired on 2026-07-30. The retired endpoint returned plain `OK` rather than model inference. The automatic reviewer workflow has therefore been disabled instead of fabricating reviewer results.

Until a genuinely independent model/session is available, author decisions remain author decisions; `final_state` must not be promoted to final ACCEPTED solely from this ledger.

## Next execution order

Continue author verification claim-by-claim, prioritizing objective ranking/market-share assertions, then material named relationships, profitability assertions, identity-changing events, export concentration and control acquisitions. Reuse inspected authoritative evidence only when issuer, claim, period and qualifier all match.
